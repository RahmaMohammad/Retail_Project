# Retail Project — Sales, Forecasting & E-commerce Planning  

A clean, end-to-end **retail data analytics project** demonstrating how raw retail data can be transformed into actionable business insights.  

This project shows how I can **analyze, visualize, and forecast retail performance** — skills directly relevant to e-commerce planning, reporting, and decision support.  


## 📊 What this project demonstrates
- **Data Cleaning** → handled missing values, standardized formats, saved cleaned datasets  
- **KPI Reporting** → Total Sales, Orders, Average Order Value (AOV)  
- **Sales Analysis** → by date, product, category, and store  
- **Visualization** → sales trends, top products, weekday/holiday patterns  
- **Forecasting & Inventory** → simple demand forecasts and out-of-stock tracker  
- **Excel Reporting** → automated dashboard exports for planning teams

📝 Notebooks with step-by-step analysis (notebooks/)
📑 Excel dashboard & planning pack (output_planning/huda_planning_pack.xlsx)
📉 Visuals: sales trends, top products, customer segmentation (output/fig_*.png)

This project shows that I can:
✔️ Work with real retail datasets
✔️ Design and report e-commerce KPIs
✔️ Create dashboards and visuals that support business planning
✔️ Apply forecasting and inventory management techniques
✔️ Package insights in a clear, reproducible GitHub portfolio


## 📌 Highlights  

The visuals below were chosen to demonstrate the most important skills for retail and e-commerce planning:  

- **KPI tracking** through sales trends over time  
- **Customer segmentation** with top-customer analysis  
- **Seasonality insights** using holiday vs non-holiday comparisons  
- **Operational planning** from weekday revenue patterns  

These charts show not just technical ability in Python and visualization, but also the **business context** turning raw data into insights that drive decisions.


## 📊 Visual Examples
